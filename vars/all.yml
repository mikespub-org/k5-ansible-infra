# REMEMBER:
#   Secutiry Groups are applied at the "port" level.  This is the port that the device NIC is
# attached to.  So it is like having a mini-firewall attached BEFORE each device NIC.
#
#   These are all about SOURCE IPs, and nothing about the destination.  Your destination is controlled by
# were you apply the SG to. Which port (device/NIC) you attach the rule to.
